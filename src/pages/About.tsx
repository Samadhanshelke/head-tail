        The Head & Tail component is a simple yet thoughtfully designed
        interactive feature that brings a playful experience to the application.
        Inspired by the classic coin toss, this component allows users to select
        between "H" (Head) and "T" (Tail) and visually stack their choices in a
        dynamic grid. Repeated values form vertical columns, while alternating
        choices create new columns â€” giving users a clear, organized
        representation of their inputs. Built with modern React and TypeScript
        practices, this component highlights our focus on user experience,
        interactivity, and clean design logic. Whether you're exploring basic
        input handling or just enjoying a visual pattern, the Head & Tail
        feature offers an engaging interface that reflects our commitment to
        thoughtful UI development.
